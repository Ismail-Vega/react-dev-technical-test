# Overview

- **Introduction**: This application is a to-do list management system with features like adding, editing, and deleting lists.
- **Technology Stack**: Include React, Redux, Material-UI, RTK Query, Axios, Jest, Cypress and React Testing Library.

## Frontend Components

- **Material-UI Integration**: All components are designed using Material-UI to ensure a consistent look and feel across the application. Material-UI's components and styles provide a modern, responsive, and accessible user interface.

## State Management

- **Redux Store**: Manages the application state, including `todoListsSlice` for to-do lists.
- **RTK Query (`todoListsApi`)**: Handles data fetching, caching, and synchronization with the backend API.

## API Integration

- **apiClient**: Axios-based client for making HTTP requests.
- **apiResponseHandler**: Handles responses and error management for API requests.

## Testing

- **Jest and React Testing Library**: Used for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing. Tests are written to cover various components and API interactions, including handling of user actions and state changes.
- **Cypress**: Used for end-to-end testing of the `TodoLists` and `Todo` CRUD operations. Tests verify the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of to-do items through the UI. This includes checking form submissions, modal interactions, and data persistence across page reloads.
